#This project is a team project for building a simple shell
Simple Shell
A functional shell that works the same as the sh. This Simple Shell will work in both interactive and non-interactive mode.

What is the Shell?

The Shell is a CLI (Command Line Interface) that provides a command based UI for Unix-like operating systems. So in short, this is where we input the commands and we get its respective output.

Getting Started
The project was written in C programming language. When compiled, it will function as the shell terminal.
